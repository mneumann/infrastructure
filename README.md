# Keep track of your infrastructure

A simple tool to keep track of your computer equipment / infrastructure

## Goals

The goal of this application is to keep track of physical and virtual
computer equipment and ask following questions about the equipment:

* Which computers (boxes) currently exist?
* Where are they located?
* What operating systems are installed on them?
* Which disks and devices are installed?
* What is the purpose of each of these boxes?
* How can a given computer be identified (network name, photo)?
* Is it connected to some network?
* Is it usable? Is the data on disk regularily backed up?
* Is it retired and can be thrown away?
* Which disks exist and what is roughly stored on it?

The intention is to keep track of this information by using one or more
TOML files and as needed links to external files (e.g. photos).
Furthermore, a simple command line utility should help with displaying
important information.
